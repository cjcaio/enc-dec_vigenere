# Enc-Dec Vigenère

This project is a web-based tool for encoding and decoding messages using the **Vigenère Cipher**. It was created as a hands-on exploration of **GoLang** for backend development, focusing on performance, understanding its structures, and adopting thoughtful design patterns. The front end complements the project with modern technologies for a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to combine a practical cryptographic tool with the opportunity to explore GoLang's backend capabilities. The Vigenère Cipher was chosen because of its historical significance and simplicity, making it perfect for experimentation while still posing interesting challenges.

### Features:
- Encode and decode messages using the Vigenère Cipher.
- A clear, user-friendly interface that makes the experience intuitive.
- Backend in GoLang designed with performance and code quality in mind.
- Modern front-end animations and styles for a polished look and feel.
- Fully responsive design to ensure usability on any device.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **GoLang:**  
  Handles all core logic for encoding/decoding and provides the API endpoints.

### Frontend:
- **React:**  
  Powers the front-end application, ensuring fast and dynamic updates to the UI.
- **Framer Motion:**  
  Adds smooth, engaging animations for an interactive experience.
- **Emotion:**  
  Delivers consistent, styled components for a clean and modern UI.

## Why This Project?
I created this project out of a passion for **cryptography** and a desire to dive into **GoLang**. By combining these interests, I could experiment with Go at a deeper level, learning about its type system and structures, while also testing its viability for backend development. On the frontend, I wanted to create something visually appealing and easy to use by utilizing modern tools like React, Emotion, and Framer Motion.

Far from being just a simple cipher tool, this project represents my journey into mastering these technologies and refining my approach to coding with clean, maintainable practices.

## Learn About the Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. While it’s no longer secure in modern contexts, it serves as a great learning tool for understanding cryptographic principles.
